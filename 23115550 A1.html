<h2>All kinds of flowers</h2>
<b>There are lots of flowers in my garden. I hope I can be happy and relaxed in my garden.</b><br><br>
 <b>This is my favorite poet 《Stray Birds》- Tagoro</b><br><br>  
 <I>Dark clouds heaven's flowers when kissed by light. So I love flowers.Life is like a rose. Each flower represents a dream, and each thorn shows a reality. The flower will wither, but the flowers will continue to bloom.</I><br>

<h2>Flowers will bloom along the road, and so will you💖</h2>
<h3>Time is something that cannot be redeemed. Perhaps making the most of time is the best effort, and effort is the best self. The wind leaves a sound, the wild geese leave a trace, and time is the most silent. We grow up unexpectedly, stumbling and growing up. Looking back, the memories of ourselves seem to have become increasingly blurred. Mountains have peaks, lakes have other shores, and in the long journey of life, everything has a turn. When we feel the aftertaste is bitter, please believe that everything will be rewarded in the end. Believe that all efforts are meaningful. Flowers will bloom along the road, and so will your future road.</h3>
<p>This is my assignment and also my attitude towards life. I hope everyone’s future life will be as splendid as flowers.</p>
